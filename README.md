Course developed by Chanin Nantasenamat (aka Data Professor). 
Check out his YouTube channel for more data science tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/c/DataProfessor

Shown are the stock **closing price** and **volume** of Google!        

TIP: to open an image from an url, like your GitHub repo, open the image and copy the image address.
For it to work on Streamlit do:
<code>
url = 'https://github.com/DataScienceLondon/Simple-Stock-Price/blob/main/blob/master/LOGO.PNG?raw=true'
st.image(url, width = 350)
</code>
instead of
<code>
image = Image.open(url)
st.image(url, width = 350)
</code>
